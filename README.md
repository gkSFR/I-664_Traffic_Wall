##  Features for Patrol
* **Live Camera Grid**: HLS streams for the MMBT and I-664 corridor.

##  Troubleshooting
* **Black Boxes on Map**: Ensure you close the current map video before clicking another pin (though the code is designed to auto-kill previous streams).
* **Buffering**: If video freezes during tower handoffs while driving, tap the **SYNC** button in the bottom nav.
* **Map Not Loading**: Ensure you have an active data connection; the map tiles require internet access to render.
