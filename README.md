##  Features
* **Live Camera Grid**: HLS streams for the MMBT and I-664 corridor.
* **Integrated Street Map**: Simple, high-contrast street map with verified GPS locations.
* **Auto-Reset Map**: Every time the **MAP** tab is clicked, it clears active videos and recenters the view.
* **One-Touch Locate**: Tap the **LOCATE** button on any camera card to instantly jump to that pin on the map.
* **Sync Button**: Tap the red **SYNC** button to force a hard refresh of all video feeds if they freeze.

---

##  Troubleshooting
* **Black Boxes on Map**: Ensure you close the current map video before clicking another pin (though the code is designed to auto-kill previous streams).
* **Buffering**: If video freezes during tower handoffs while driving, tap the **SYNC** button in the bottom nav.
* **Map Not Loading**: Ensure you have an active data connection; the map tiles require internet access to render.
